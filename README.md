# Genki-Dama (元気玉 / Spirit Bomb)

Genki-Dama, inspired by the iconic Dragon Ball technique, is the first open-source machine learning training framework that harnesses the collective power of decentralized computing resources. Built upon the robust foundation of Crynux, Genki-Dama empowers you to train models faster and more efficiently than ever before, shattering the limitations of traditional, centralized approaches

It includes two parts:
* Genki: machine-learning SDK to utilize Crynux decentralized computing resources
* Dama: open-sourced model checkpoints
